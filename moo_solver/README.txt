*** Abstract***

Multi-objective optimization plays a key role in the study of real-world problems, as they often involve multiple criteria. In multi-objective optimization, it is important to identify the so-called Pareto frontier, which characterizes the trade-offs between the objectives of different solutions. We provide a C++ implementation of exact and approximate dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for computing the Pareto frontier on tree-structured networks. The code uses a specialized divide-and-conquer approach for the pruning of dominated solutions. This optimization outperforms the previous approaches, leading to speed-ups of two to three orders of magnitude in practice.

We apply a rounding technique to the exact dynamic programming algorithm that provides a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS). The FPTAS finds a solution set of polynomial-size, which approximates the Pareto frontier within an arbitrary small e factor and runs in time that is polynomial in the size of the instance and 1/ep.  

We illustrate the code by evaluating trade-offs in ecosystem services due to the proliferation of hydropower dams throughout the MYANMAR basin. In particular, we apply our algorithms to identify portfolios of hydropower dam sites that simultaneously minimize impacts on river flow, river connectivity, sediment transport, fish biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy production goals, at different scales, including the entire MYANMAR basin. The code can be easily adapted to compute the Pareto frontier of various multi-objective problems for other river basins or other tree-structured networks. This work is described in the manuscript  by Flecker et al., entitled “Reducing adverse impacts of MYANMAR hydropower expansion” in press, Science, 2021.

*** Compilation ***

Open a terminal window: The following instructions assume that the user will be issuing commands from a terminal window. 
 
There are two options for compiling and running the code
1) If g++ is installed correctly, run the following command within the source code directory:

   g++ -std=gnu++11 DP_Algorithm.cpp Frontier_List.cpp HyperNet.cpp main.cpp Pareto_Opt_Node.cpp Pareto_Opt_List.cpp Pareto_Solution.cpp -o MYANMAR

2) Otherwise, make sure cmake and some c++ build toolchain/compiler (with c++11 support) are installed.
   Then run the two commands:

   cmake ./
   cmake --build ./

Both methods will generate an executable called "MYANMAR"

Notes on installation:
- CMake can be downloaded at https://cmake.org/download/. After downloading CMake, make sure to 
  install CMake for command line use. On a Mac, this can be done by:
      a) Opening the CMake application
      b) Select Tools from the top menu
      c) Select "How to Install for Command Line Use"
      d) Follow the instructions for the second option "Or, to install symlinks to '/usr/local/bin', run:"
         where you must copy and run the command "sudo ... --install" into a terminal window.

- For a mac, one quick way to ensure that you have a proper c++ compiler is to install the commandline developer tools (or all of Xcode) by running: 

    xcode-select --install

*** Usage ***

Move to the directory where the executable MYANMAR is. Then issue the following command:

./MYANMAR -criteria NUMBER_OF_CRITERIA CRITERIA_NAME ... CRITERIA_NAME -batch BATCH_SIZE -basin BASIN_NAME path INPUT_FILENAME -epsilon ROUNDING_EPSILON

Options:
    Important notation
    ------------------------
    max/min = a string that is either "max" or "min"
    ------------------------

    -criteria <int> <string> ... <string>
     (required) Reads in relevant criteria. The number of strings provided must equal the 
     first integer argument.
    -path <string> 
     (required) The file path with the data for the river basin
    -basin <string>
     (required) The name of the river basin that we are working on
    -seed <int> 
     The random seed to use in the experiment (NOTE: if this is not given a random seed is chosen)
    -epsilon <double>
     Real valued epsilon in the range [0.0, 1.0] used for the epsilon 
     approximation (rounding) in the experiments. For two criteria problems, 
     use epsilon=0 to get the exact Pareto frontier. For faster results, consider 
     using epsilon=0.05 (i.e. within 5% theoretical guarantee of the true Pareto Frontier).    
    -batch <int>
     Number of solutions to keep in a batch when pruning dominated partial solution. 
     Commonly used batch sizes are 1000000 or 10000000 depending on available memory.
    -thread <int>
     Number of threads to use for parallelization. A good default value is 6 
    
*** Example of Running the Executable ***

        ./MYANMAR -criteria 2 energy connectivity -basin MYANMAR -path AB_cppinput_2021_Feb.txt -epsilon 0.001 -batch 10000000
        ./MYANMAR -criteria 2 energy connectivity -basin MYANMAR -path AB_cppinput_2021_Feb.txt -epsilon 0 -batch 10000000
        ./MYANMAR -criteria 3 energy connectivity sediment -basin MYANMAR -path AB_cppinput_2021_Feb.txt -epsilon 0.1 -batch 10000000
	./MYANMAR -criteria 6 energy connectivity sediment biodiversity dor ghg -basin Napo -path napo_cppinput_2021_Feb.txt -epsilon 0.05 -batch 10000000
	./MYANMAR -criteria 6 energy connectivity sediment biodiversity dor ghg -basin Napo -path napo_cppinput_2021_Feb.txt -epsilon 0 -batch 10000000

[Note that we always include energy as the first criterion. The reason is that energy is the only criterion we have that encourages building more dams. If we do not include energy as a criterion, we get a single optimal solution where we build no dams.]
[The output files can be easily read on a terminal window or a text editor] 
[Optimizing for energy and connectivity for epsilon = 0.001 for the whole MYANMAR (99.9% accuracy) should take around 10 seconds; optimizing for energy and connectivity for epsilon = 0 (exact) should take around 2 minutes; optimizing for three criteria: energy, connectivity, and sediment for epsilon = 0.1 (90% accuracy) should take around 80 seconds; optimizing for six criteria for the Napo basin (a basin with 24 dams) for epsilon = 0.05 (95% accuracy) should take below 1 second; optimizing for six criteria for the Napo basin (a basin with 24 dams) for epsilon = 0 (exact) should take around 2 seconds.  These run times were obtained using a MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 16GB RAM. 
[* Currently we can only run for six criteria within reasonable time and error bound on smaller basins such as the Maranon or the Napo. DO NOT attempt to run for six criteria on the whole MYANMAR. For more information, refer to the last section of the README.]

*** Computing the Pareto Frontier for six criteria***
The runtime of this algorithm we developed is polynomial with regard to the number of dams but still exponential with regard to the number of criteria, which means that both the runtime and the number of solutions will increase dramatically as the number of objectives goes up. For instance, for two criteria (energy and ghg), we are able to compute the exact Pareto frontier (epsilon=0) for the whole MYANMAR within 20 minutes (wall-clock time, 36 threads; around 10 hours CPU time) depending on the criteria we choose; for five criteria, we are able to run the algorithm for (epsilon=0.4) for the whole MYANMAR in 17 hours (wall-clock time, 36 threads; around 9.3 days CPU time); 

When optimizing for 6 criteria for the MYANMAR basin, however, we can only run for large error margins like epsilon=1.5 or epsilon=2.0, and the runtimes are 2 days and 7 hours (wall-clock time, 36 threads), respectively. The solution we employed to deal with the heavy costs and large error margins associated with optimizing for more criteria is to complement the approximate Pareto frontier with optimization results for all possible 2 criteria and 3 criteria combinations. Note that when we do not include energy as a criterion, we get a single optimal solution where we build no dams. Therefore, we only need to run the algorithm for criteria combinations that include energy, which are five 2 criteria combinations and ten 3 criteria combination.
